<p>
It’s a pleasure to be a part of the Bsc (Hons) Software Systems Development course and here’s a few facts about myself:<br><br>
I’m originally English and was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire. My family moved to Wexford 19 years ago, though my parents have since moved back to England
and I now rent the family home with my girlfriend.
<br><br>
I just turned 26 and am part of this Software Systems Development course as a mature student. 
I have completed two level 5 PLC courses in the past and see this course as my best opportunity for a meaningful career.
